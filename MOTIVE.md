# What's wrong about AngularJS

## Ugly markups
## unnecessary binding
## immature model interation

# What's wrong about React

## Big structure is big chance of strange bugs. Why should we take it?
## Without JSX, it's utterly full of code smells.

Virtually we need to use JSX as well.

# What's wrong about Polymer

## The basic concept is great.
## Basic elements are ugly and quite nonsensical.

What's iron, neon, gold, silver or paper?

## We are betrayed of the promise that there going to be "meaningful" markups again.

We don't call things like `<iron-blah-blah>` or `<neon-blah-blah>` meaningful because those names are utterly nonsense.

## Basic elements are very important because it's basic vocabulary of Polymer world. But it seems that very small number of people in Google quite arbitrarily decided those names.
