- Very few APIs, compared to other mvc frmwrks
- "Everything is an element" as Polymer says, but much more simple
- Separation of concerns in stricter sense
  - business logic, view component, service context, application
- No 2-way bindings
- Does event propagation by using dom event propagation, no unnecessary new mechanism.
