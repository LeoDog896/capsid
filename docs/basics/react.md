# vs React

`capsid`'s approach to UI programming is different from React's. React sees reactive markups (`jsx`) as a View. `capsid` sees HTMLElement as a Passive View.

In React programming, you declare how to update your markups by the props (external states) and states (internal states). In Capsid programming, you declare how to react to the events.
