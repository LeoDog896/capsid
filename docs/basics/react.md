# vs React

`capsid`'s approach to UI programming is different from React's. React sees reactive markups (`jsx`) as a View. `capsid` sees HTMLElement as a [Passive View](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html).

In React programming, you declare how to update your markups by the `props` (external states) and `state` (internal states). In Capsid programming, you declare how to react to the events.
