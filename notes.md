- Remember "modal" of bootstrap
- element + coelement = (class-)component
- class-component is a jquery plugin
- class-component uses jquery features deeply
- class-component exposes only a few APIs
- class-component can be used in a very minimal way
- class-component can implement entire todo-mvc
- class-component is small
- each class-component is dependent of other components
- the range of responsibility of each component is clear
- works smoothly with native dom APIs and jQuery APIs
